# Guide on Contributing

Thank you for taking interest in `chill` and making it it even more chill. There
are many ways to contribute to this project and improve things.

There is also this helpful guide on
[How to contribute to an open source project](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Goal of Chill

Create simple and versatile websites that are database driven when rendering the
requested content. A website can either have all it's files generated (frozen)
to allow static hosting, or be dynamic and use a connection to a database. The
software also needs to maintain it's appreciation of llamas.

To sum up:

* Simple - The learning curve to use `chill` is not steep
* Database Driven - Let the database do what it's good at
* Programming Language Agnostic - It is not required to author any code
    in order to use `chill` for a website
* Llamas - They're great, right?
